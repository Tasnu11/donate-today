            <p>Floods can strike quickly and with little warning in many parts of the world. Surviving a flood is a combination of preparation and appropriate action as soon as the disaster begins.<br> Prepare yourself for a flood by packing an emergency kit and finding shelter. Stay away from water and stick to high ground during the flood. Afterwards, cautiously return home.<br> Disinfect and repair affected areas so you will stay safe even after the water is gone.
